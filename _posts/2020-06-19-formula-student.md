For the majority of my time at University, I have been involved with Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS)
which is a student project competing in the prestigious [Formula Student](https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student)
competition. I have established the autonomous racecar student project within the team aiming to compete in the brand
new competition class - Formula Student Driverless. Through the last 2 years, **I have led a passionate team of
about 40 students to 2 victories in the UK competition** and have raised a budget of over Â£50,000.
This allowed me to obtain practical hands-on experience in the topics I am interested in (Robotics and AI)
as well as develop my **team working, management, leadership and communication skills**.

Technically, I have been involved in about every part of our car but I have focused mostly on the software side.
I have led the development of:

- Development of our [own simulation](https://gitlab.com/eufs/eufs_sim)
- Real-time CNN stereo camera object detection
- Lidar object detecion
- Object fusion with camera and lidar
- Dynamic state estimation by fusing 4 sensor inputs asynchronously with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- Localisation and Mapping of the track using FastSLAM
- Planning and Control for the car using an innovative algorithm called Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI).
Actually, I did my [dissertation](files/Ignat_MInf1_project.pdf) on it.

My personal development from this project has been so enormous that it is hard to describe it with words.
It has taught me how to work in a team, communicate ideas; it has allowed me to obtain practical experience,
hone my technical skills and apply the theory I have learned in the classroom. Formula Student started
my interest in robotics and self-driving cars and even made me change my degree. To put it simply,
I owe much of what I am today to the Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS) team and
all of the wonderful people behind it!
