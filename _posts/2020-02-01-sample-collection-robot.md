For a course in university, I developed the software for a sample collection
robot based on a Turtlebot3 robot with a manipulator. The robot is capable
of localizing and autonomously navigating within a known environment. It
can also use its arm to push buttons, move obstacles and collect samples
(yes mars rover style). The open source repository of the project is [here](https://gitlab.com/imgeorgiev/rss_turtlebot)
