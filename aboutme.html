Currently pursuing <strong>MInf Informatics</strong> at the University of Edinburgh with a focus on robotics, machine learning and embedded systems.

<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
I enjoy writing bridging the gap between code and the real world. Showing to people that software doesn't only live on a computer and can physically impact us in a significant manner. Also, I've always had an urge engaging young people in STEM.

The <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also view my (somewhat outdated) <a href="/files/Ignat_Georgiev_CV.pdf">CV</a>.

<span class="fa fa-globe about-icon"></span>
Originally, from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razgrad">Razgrad, Bulgaria</a></i>, I have always been fascinated by how computers have impacted our world. After high school, I moved to the beautiful city of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh, UK</a></i> to pursue better education (and wet weather apparently). At some point throughout University, I got intrigued by robotics and are now focusing extensively on that field.

In my free time, I enjoy travelling, cycling, hiking, photography, weightlifting, playing video games and volunteering. Oh did I also mention my watch collection?
