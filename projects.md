For the majority of my time at University, I have been involved with Edinburgh University Formula Student whose aim is to provide
undergraduate students with the opportunity to design and build a single-seat racecar for competition and get a bunch of experience
along the way. My main contribution to that is the founding the Autonomous branch of the team which addressed the new competition
format - Formula Student Driverless challenging students to develop a fully autonomous racecar. Within a single year, I gathered
a team of talented students from the University of Edinburgh with which we developed the self-driving software and attended
the Formula Student UK 2018 competition. We successfully uploaded our software to the vehicle provided by the competition
organisers and completed an autonomous lap.

Technically, I have been involved in various parts of the whole car including but not limited to path planning and control
using cutting-edge algorithms such as MPPI, landmark SLAMs and VSLAM approaches, state estimation using EKFs and machine
learning object extraction via cameras and Lidar.

My personal development from this project has been so enormous that it is hard to describe it with words. It has taught me
how to work in a team, communicate ideas; it has allowed me to obtain practical experience, hone my technical skills and apply
the theory I have learned in the classroom. Formula Student started my interest in robotics and self-driving cars and even made
me change my degree. To put it simply, I owe much of what I am today to the Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS) team and
all of the wonderful people behind it.

## Python courses
I have developed a series of Python courses aimed to teach both general-purpose and research-orientated programming skills. These were intended to introduce beginners to the world of coding easily and safely. As a result of the start from the absolute basics of programming and go all the way up to physics simulations and big data applications. These courses were done in Jupyter notebook for a user-friendly experience and can be found on my GitHub account.

## [OfficePal](https://github.com/Ignat-Georgiev/SDP_G19_OfficeBot)
A group project as part of my degree. OfficePal is a small differential drive robot built with Lego. It operates within an office environment where all desks are connected through black-coloured lines and can deliver items between desks using the tray attached on top of the robot. This course taught me the essentials of teamwork, collaboration, management and hard work.

A spinoff from this project is a [Python TCP event-based library](https://github.com/Ignat-Georgiev/tcpcom) I made for the distributed computing system of the robot.


## [Weather Widget](https://github.com/Ignat-Georgiev/WeatherWidget)
As a side project, I developed a hacky cheap Nest alternative which can display time, weather forecast, ambient information and can be controlled via a touchscreen. Furthermore, it can be connected to other WiFi-enabled devices and can control other IoT devices using MQTT. All of this for less than 30$. I still keep one on my wall to this date :). Missed business opportunity right here. The project including source code and PCB design and manufacturing instructions can be found on my GitHub.
