    Enthusiastic, dedicated and hard-working student set to graduate my Masterâ€™s in 2020. I am passionate about robotics
    and believe
    that with the help of AI they will cause the next industrial revolution, and I would like to be part of it!
    This belief led me to establish an autonomous racecar student project within my university.

    Currently pursuing <strong>MSc Robotics & AI</strong> at the University of Edinburgh with a focus on robotics,
    Machine Learning and embedded systems.
    Set to graduate June 2020. I am currently doing my <b>dissertation on Dynamic Path Planning and Control
    for an Autonomous Racecar</b> in collaboration with a company called Roborace. Part 1 of my dissertation can be
    <a href="/files/Ignat_MInf1_project.pdf">found here</a>.

    My <b>previous job experience</b> includes working at <b>Roborace</b> on developing a reference
    <b>autonomous driving software stack</b>. I was also involved in various other bits including
    software infrastructure, deployment, localisation, mapping and path planning.

    For 2 summers I have also interned at Indie Semiconductor where I have worked on firmware
    development for custom microcontrollers for IoT and automotive applications.

    My technical skills include C/C++, Python, ROS, CUDA, PyTorch, Tensorfow,
    Version Control (i.e. git), CI & CD, Operating Systems, Distributed computing,
    Parallel computing and robotics simulators. Through time, I've also gotten good at
    team working, management, leadership and the all-important communcation skill.

    <span class="fa fa-globe about-icon"></span>
    Originally, from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razgrad">Razgrad, Bulgaria</a></i>, I have always been
    fascinated by
    how computers have impacted our world. After high school, I moved to the beautiful city
    of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh, UK</a></i> to pursue better education (and wet
    weather apparently).
    At some point throughout University, I got intrigued by robotics and are now focusing extensively on that field.

    In my free time, I enjoy travelling, cycling, bouldering, weightlifting, playing video games and volunteering. Oh
    did I also mention that I fly racing drones? Here is my a picture of my lovely little drones
    called Diana.
