This is a collection of some personal projects I've worked on that are easily viewable online. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

## Formula Student
For the majority of my time at University I have been involved with Edinburgh University Formula Student whose aim is to provide undergraduate students with the opportunity to design and build a single-seat racecar for a compeition and get a bunch of experience along the way. My main contribution to that is the founding the Autonomous branch of the team which addressed the new competition format - Formula Student Drierless challening students to develop a fully autonomous racecar. Within a single year, I gathered a team of talented students from the University of Edinburgh with which we developed the self-driving software and attended the Formula Student UK 2018 competition. We succesfully uploaded our software to the vehicle provided by the competition organisers and successfully completed an autonomous lap.
