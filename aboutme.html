<p class="about-text">
Enthusiastic, dedicated and hard-working student set to graduate my Masterâ€™s in 2020. I am passionate about robotics and believe
that with the help of AI they will cause the next industrial revolution, and I would like to be part of it!
This belief led me to establish an autonomous racecar student project within my university.

Currently pursuing <strong>MSc Robotics & AI</strong> at the University of Edinburgh with a focus on robotics, Machine Learning and embedded systems.
Set to graduate June 2020. I am currently doing my dissertation on Dynamic Path Planning and Control
for an Autonomous Racecar in collaboration with a company called Roborace. Part 1 of my dissertation can be <a href="/files/Ignat_MInf1_project.pdf">found here</a>.

My technical skills include C/C++, Python, ROS, CUDA, PyTorch, Tensorfow,
Version Control (i.e. git), CI & CD, Operating Systems, Distributed computing,
Parallel computing and robotics simulators. Through time, I've also gotten good at
team working, management, leadership and the all-important communcation skill.

<span class="fa fa-globe about-icon"></span>
Originally, from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razgrad">Razgrad, Bulgaria</a></i>, I have always been fascinated by
how computers have impacted our world. After high school, I moved to the beautiful city
of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh, UK</a></i> to pursue better education (and wet weather apparently).
At some point throughout University, I got intrigued by robotics and are now focusing extensively on that field.

In my free time, I enjoy travelling, cycling, bouldering, weightlifting, playing video games and volunteering. Oh did I also mention that I fly racing drones?
