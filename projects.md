This is a collection of some personal projects I've worked on that are easily viewable online. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

## Formula Student
For the majority of my time at University I have been involved with Edinburgh University Formula Student whose aim is to provide undergraduate students with the opportunity to design and build a single-seat racecar for a compeition and get a bunch of experience along the way. My main contribution to that is the founding the Autonomous branch of the team which addressed the new competition format - Formula Student Drierless challening students to develop a fully autonomous racecar. Within a single year, I gathered a team of talented students from the University of Edinburgh with which we developed the self-driving software and attended the Formula Student UK 2018 competition. We succesfully uploaded our software to the vehicle provided by the competition organisers and successfully completed an autonomous lap.

## Python courses
I have developed a series of Python courses aimed to teach both general-purpose and research-orientated programming skills. These were aimed to introduce begginners to the world of coding in a easy and safe way. As a result the start from the absolute basics of programming and go all the way up to physics simulations and big data applications. This was done in Jupyter notebook for a user-friendly experience and can be found on my github account. 


## Weather Widget
As a side project, I developed a hacky cheap Nest alternative which can display time, weather forcast, ambient information and can be controlled via a touch screen. Furthermore it can be connected to other WiFi enabled devices and can control other IoT devices using MQTT. All of this for less than 30$. I still keep one on my wall to this date :) . Missed business opportunity right here. The project including source code and PCB design and manufacturing instructions can be found on my github.
