Once I wored as a **Digital Skills tutor** at the University of Edinburgh I have developed a series of Python
courses aimed to teach both general-purpose and research-orientated
programming skills. These were intended to introduce beginners to the world of coding easily and safely.
As a result of the start from the absolute basics of programming and go all the way up to physics simulations
and big data applications.
