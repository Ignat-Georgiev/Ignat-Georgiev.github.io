## [Formula Student](http://eufs.eusa.ed.ac.uk)

For the majority of my time at University, I have been involved with Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS)
which is a student project competing in the prestigious [Formula Student](https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student)
competition. I have established the autonomous racecar student project within the team aiming to compete in the brand
new competition class - Formula Student Driverless. Through the last 2 years, **I have led a passionate team of
about 40 students to 2 victories in the UK competition** and have raised a budget of over Â£50,000.
This allowed me to obtain practical hands-on experience in the topics I am interested in (Robotics and AI)
as well as develop my **team working, management, leadership and communication skills**.


Technically, I have been involved in about every part of our car but I have focused mostly on the software side.
I have led the development of:
- Development of our [own simulation](https://gitlab.com/eufs/eufs_sim)
- Real-time CNN stereo camera object detection
- Fusing camera and Lidar object detection algorithms
- Dynamic state estimation by fusing 4 sensor inputs asynchronously with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- Localisation and Mapping of the track using FastSLAMv2
- Planning and Control for the car using an innovative algorithm called Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI).
Actually, I did my [dissertation](files/Ignat_MInf1_project.pdf) on it.

My personal development from this project has been so enormous that it is hard to describe it with words.
It has taught me how to work in a team, communicate ideas; it has allowed me to obtain practical experience,
hone my technical skills and apply the theory I have learned in the classroom. Formula Student started
my interest in robotics and self-driving cars and even made me change my degree. To put it simply,
I owe much of what I am today to the Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS) team and
all of the wonderful people behind it!

## Drone racing
I have also picked up a hobby inline with my interest - racing quadcopters. I have built myself a light
and powerful quad called Diana and she is capable of reaching speeds up to 160 kph. I have built her
using commercially available components, designed and 3D printed her some extras and configured
a controller for her using the open-source software Betaflight. In fact, I love this hobby so much
that I have became an active contributor of Betaflight.

## Python courses
Once I wored as a **Digital Skills tutor** at the University of Edinburgh I have developed a series of Python
courses aimed to teach both general-purpose and research-orientated
programming skills. These were intended to introduce beginners to the world of coding easily and safely.
As a result of the start from the absolute basics of programming and go all the way up to physics simulations
and big data applications.

## [Weather Widget](https://gitlab.com/imgeorgiev/WeatherWidget)
As a side project, I developed a hacky cheap Nest alternative which can display time, weather forecast,
ambient information and can be controlled via a touchscreen. Furthermore, it can be connected to
other WiFi-enabled devices and can control other IoT devices using MQTT. All of this for less than 30$.
I still keep one on my wall to this date :). Missed business opportunity right here. The project including
source code and PCB design and manufacturing instructions can be found on my GitHub.


## [OfficePal](https://github.com/Ignat-Georgiev/SDP_G19_OfficeBot)
A group project as part of my degree. OfficePal is a small differential drive robot built with Lego.
It operates within an office environment where all desks are connected through black-coloured lines
and can deliver items between desks using the tray attached on top of the robot. This course taught
me the essentials of teamwork, collaboration, management and hard work.

A spinoff from this project is a [Python TCP event-based library](https://gitlab.com/imgeorgiev/tcpcom)
I made for the distributed computing system of the robot.
