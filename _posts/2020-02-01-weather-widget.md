As a side project, I developed a hacky cheap Nest alternative which can display time, weather forecast,
ambient information and can be controlled via a touchscreen. Furthermore, it can be connected to
other WiFi-enabled devices and can control other IoT devices using MQTT. All of this for less than 30$.
I still keep one on my wall to this date :). Missed business opportunity right here. The project including
source code and PCB design and manufacturing instructions can be found on my GitHub.
